# Conway's Game of Life
**Conway's Game of Life** is a simple game that has the concept of cells. Each cell has two states: dead or alive. With that you can create a lot of interesting patterns (see more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## How the game works
The only thing you have to do is place or delete cells and see what they do!

## Controls
With the mouse left button and right button you place and delete cells respectively, and with the space button you can pause the game (in case the game is paused it will appear a sprite in the bottom left)

## How to run it
First you need *python3* and the *collections* module (*pip install collections*). Make sure to keep all of the scripts in the same folder in order for the game to work

## Things to do
I still have to fix some things, but the game is almost finished. The other goal i want to do is make an exe file so you dont have to build it by your own.
