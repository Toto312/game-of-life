# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a simple game that has the concept of cells. Each cell has two states: dead or alive. And by that you can do a lot of interesting patterns (see more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## How the game works
The only thing you have to do is create or delete cells and se what they do!

## Controls
With the mouse left button and right button you create and delete scenes respectively, and with the space button you can pause or despause the game (in case the game is paused it will appear a sprite in the bottom left)
